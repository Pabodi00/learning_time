# Data Types in Programming

A data type is a classification of data that informs the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.


##  Why Data types are important???

Based on the programming languages there are many data types that stores data in a specific way. Data type is an property that tells the computer how to evaluate the value of the data programmer entered.  By understanding the data type, it ensures the collected data is in the expected format.


## Why different data types are needed?

Inside a computer, different types of data are represented in different ways, according the program the size of the data varied. So, using data types allocate a specific memory space to store them. They can also be subjected to a number of different operations. All values belonging to the same data type will have the same representation


## Common Data Types..

- Integer (int)  -1 to 8 bytes
- Floating Point (float) -4 to 8 bytes
- Character (char) - 1 byte
- String (str or text) -Limited to the amount that can be stored in main memory
- Boolean (bool) - 1 bit
